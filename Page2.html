        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089; ">The Bidding Process</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Let's say anyone is hunting for Jackson Hole condos in Miami. This is the type of knowledge Google considers:
            For every variable in a keyword function, Google will relate a probability of the conversion. In this case, the user is on a mobile phone in North Miami. According to the advertiserâ€™s past data, this scenario has been successful.

        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089; ">AI Efficiency</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Within a single program, the less variables you have, the faster you know. Let us presume that we have three similar systems which can process only ten entries per second to understand output.
            You will notice that the longer it takes to review data when you increase the number of variables. The closest you are to your speed cap, the lower the device performance.</p>



        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089; ">Interesting Fact about AI</p>

        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Google will not give a conversion rate of any one attribute if you have a campaign targeted at the United States.

        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089; ">Conclusion</p>


            <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">While many assume that automation gives up the campaign power, that's not real. Learning the dynamics of artificial intelligence for the strategies is important.</p>
