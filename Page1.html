        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: xx-large; ">Here are 4 Mind Blowing facts about Facebook on using the AI.</p>

            
        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;; ">To decide which TV shows you see.</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Facebook Watch isn't a digital digital wrist. Lovrien describes it as "Your own personal tv, if you like. To configure the material you view, he says, "based on your preference, your preferences, the preferences of your friends, where you have signed in, [and] where you're going." Facebook makes computer teaching predictions.</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;; ">To fix Facebook Live’s problems.</p>
        

        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">"Sharing is necessary," quoted from the 2013 novel The Circle of Dave Eggers, in which a function such as Facebook Live leads to a death for a man. And people have spread rape, murder by police and other violent acts via Facebook Live. "At Facebook Live, there is some negativity and I can live with it," says Lovrien. "We 're also working with AI to solve them," he says without going into depth.</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;; ">To identify porn — but not hate speech</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">If Facebook has ever been inconsistent about its modesty policies, blame a machine. "The AI program uses AI often to track porn," says Lovrien. she says. The network does not have a individual to review pornographical grievances or search the internet to locate them. About 98 percent of all pornography articles fall under artificial intelligence.</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;; ">To keep employees safe</p>


        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Every day, approximately 20,000 people come to Facebook offices, but there is no badge system to tell who should and who's not there. Employees instead stay with guests and warn against suspiciousness. However, Lovrien says that they don't use the machine, "They want to put out a letter."

            The global security and investigative team of Facebook uses security bottlenecks. </p>
