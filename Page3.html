            Similarly, Under Armour utilizes IBM's Watson to merge data from its Record device with data from third parties in order to provide customers with customized instruction.</p>
    
            <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;">Search Engine Algorithms</p>



            <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Google's search engine giant used RankBrain, an AI system, to sophisticate analysis of search queries. Google Search can provide the users faster and more reliable results by utilizing Machine Learning, where the search engine algorithm learns itself how to perceive search queries on the basis of the intent of a searcher rather than a predetermined system.</p>


            <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;">Programmatic Advertising</p>


            <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">In ad targeting, it is a challenge for companies such as Google Ads to sell their ad inventory to display the right ads for the right customer in the right time.

                However, Google has been able to automatically acquire and sell ad inventory by combining power from AI and real-time inventory contracts across mobile, viewing, video and social channels, by incorporating artificial intelligence technologies such as programmatic advertising.</p>
    
                <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: x-large; color: #a28089;">Email Marketing Language</p>



                <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">In e-mail marketing, better e-mails are the best way to get more clicks, boost open rates and enhance responses.

                    Businesses such as Phrasee also have established a computer-based creative email marketing tool for businesses to compose effective headlines and use their customer-oriented email marketing vocabulary to improve views, prices and profits.</p>
