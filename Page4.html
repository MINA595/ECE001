        <p style="padding: 0.5%; font-size: xx-large;">In this page I will give a topic about how Amazon uses AI</p>
        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Amazon has always had an edge in using AI to improve its corporate efficiency, since he early adopted artificial intelligence and automatication. Not only did AI boost its consumer service, it was similarly highly oriented.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">Amazon's AI capabilities are designed to offer customized recommendations for their clients, ranging from the use of AI to the number of customers ready to buy a new product for a cashier-free grocery store. According to a report, 35 per cent of total sales are driven by Amazon's recommendation motor.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0.5%;font-size: 12pt;">One of the main ways that Amazon actively utilizes AI is to consider the consumer search requests and why they want a particular product. In order to make relevant recommendations to their customers for an e-commerce business, it is vital that they understand not only what their customers are looking for, but also that a customer understands why a product is searching.</p>
